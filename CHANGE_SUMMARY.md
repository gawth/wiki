# Image Resize Enhancement

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Client-Side Interface**
   - Added interactive resize dialog with side-by-side preview
   - Added percentage-based resizing with slider and presets
   - Added manual dimension inputs with aspect ratio preservation
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

2. **Improved Server-Side Resizing**
   - Implemented high-quality image resizing with proper aspect ratio preservation
   - Added support for different image formats (JPEG, PNG)
   - Increased JPEG quality to preserve image details
   - Added proper error handling and logging

3. **Fixed CSS Issues**
   - Changed `width: 80%` to `max-width: 80%` to respect natural image dimensions
   - This allows resized images to display at their actual size while still preventing oversized images

## Note for Future Work

This work was done directly on the `image-paste-feature` branch. Going forward, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Always create a dedicated feature branch for new work**
2. **Never make changes directly on master**
3. **Run tests before submitting changes**

The project now includes a Git workflow section in CLAUDE.md that outlines these best practices.
